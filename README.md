# Phishing Simulation & Security Awareness Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a controlled phishing simulation to help understand how phishing attacks work in real-world scenarios.
It is developed strictly for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes, focusing on how attackers exploit human behavior rather than system vulnerabilities.

The project uses static HTML pages to simulate fake login workflows and highlights how users can be tricked into entering sensitive information on malicious websites.

## Objectives

* Understand phishing attack workflows in a controlled environment
* Demonstrate how fake login pages are used in social engineering attacks
* Create security awareness about suspicious links and webpages
* Strengthen defensive cybersecurity knowledge

---

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Git & GitHub

---

## Prerequisites

* Git installed on the system
* Any modern web browser
* Internet connection

---

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prithakdas/phishing-simulation-awareness.git
cd phishing-simulation-awareness
```

---

### 2. Open the Simulation Pages

**Windows**

```bash
start index.html
```
